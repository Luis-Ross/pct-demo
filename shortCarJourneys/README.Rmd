```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Setup

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tmap)
library(sf)
```


## Access data

The data was downloaded as follows:

```{r cars}
if(dir.exists("shortCarJourneys")) setwd("shortCarJourneys")
base_url = "https://github.com/npct/pct-outputs-regional-notR/raw/master/commute/msoa/"
pct_files = c("c.geojson", "l.geojson", "rf.geojson", "rq.geojson", "rnet.geojson", "z.geojson")
region = "west-yorkshire/" # can change
i = pct_files[1]
if(!file.exists("c.geojson")) {
  for(i in pct_files) {
  download.file(paste0(base_url, region, i), i)
  }
}
```

```{r, results='hide'}
cents = st_read(dsn = "c.geojson")
l = st_read(dsn = "l.geojson")
rf = st_read(dsn = "rf.geojson")
rnet = st_read(dsn = "rnet.geojson")
z = st_read(dsn = "z.geojson")
```

## Short car journeys in the region

We set a limit defining short car journeys as 5 km on the 'fast' routes.
In practice this could be any distance. We also set a limit on the minum number of people who drive to work, to focus the data:

```{r}
max_distance = 5
min_drivers = 50
```

These can be selected and visualised as follows:

```{r}
short_car_journeys = rf %>% 
  filter(rf_dist_km < 5, car_driver > 50)
tmap_mode("view")
qtm(short_car_journeys, lines.col = "car_driver", alpha = 0.1, lines.lwd = 4)
```
